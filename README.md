# Introduction to Phylogenetics

This workshop is designed as an introduction to phylogenetics, intended for those with an interest in ecology, evolution or whole ecosystem science. No previous knowledge of the topic is required. The first session (2nd December) covers background theory and an overview of the main methods of constructing phylogenies. The second session (9th December) covers further analyses which can be carried out using phylogenies, including modelling diversity through time, phylogeographic histories and trait evolution.
