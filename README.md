# Introduction to Phylogenetics

This workshop is designed as an introduction to phylogenetics, intended for those with an interest in ecology, evolution or whole ecosystem science. No previous knowledge of the topic is required. The first session (2nd December) covers background theory and an overview of the main methods of constructing phylogenies. The second session (9th December) covers further analyses which can be carried out using phylogenies, including modelling diversity through time, phylogeographic histories and trait evolution.

Slides from the lecture parts of the workshop can be viewed in the "Slides" folder above.

If you are familiar with R, you can find a script for simple tree manipulation, with some trees to practice on, in the "R code" folder above.

# Extra resources

If you want to look at or edit nexus/tree files, I would recommend using a good plain text editor to preserve file types and formatting. For Windows, I like Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org), and for Mac OS, I like Atom (https://atom.io).

GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/) is the biggest repository of open-access genetic sequence data, and is a good place to start looking if you're thinking about building a phylogeny.

The best place to get fossil data is the Paleobiology Database (https://paleobiodb.org/). I know this database well, so if you are interested in using fossil data in your analyses I would be happy to answer questions about it!

https://icytree.org is a great web-based tree visualiser, just drag and drop your Newick to see the tree.

www.mesquiteproject.org is a nice program for carrying out simple tasks with phylogenies. I previously used it to build phylogenies by hand: you can enter your list of OTUs, drag and drop your branches, then export to a Newick file for further visualisation or analysis.
